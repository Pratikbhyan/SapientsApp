## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information that you provide directly to us, as well as information collected automatically when you use the App.

### 1.1 Information You Provide Directly

When you use the App, you may provide us with the following information:

*   **Account Information:**
    *   **Google Sign-In:** If you choose to sign up or log in using Google Sign-In, we collect your email address and display name as provided by Google. This information is used to create and manage your user account, personalize your experience, and facilitate your access to the App's features. We handle this data in accordance with Google's API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. For more information, please review Google's Privacy Policy ([https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).
    *   **Other Account Information (if applicable):** [If you offer other ways to create an account, or collect other direct information like profile pictures, please detail it here. If not, you can remove this sub-bullet.]
*   **User-Generated Content (e.g., Audio, Transcriptions, Notes):** The App may allow you to create, upload, or interact with content such as audio recordings, transcriptions derived from audio, or notes associated with content. We collect and store this data to provide the App's core functionality, such as playback, display, and synchronization. **(Please adjust this section to accurately reflect how your app handles audio, transcriptions, and any other user-generated content. Specify if audio is recorded by the user through the app, or if it's about interacting with pre-existing content, creating notes, etc. Be specific about what is collected and why.)**

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

When you use the Sapients App, we and our service providers may automatically collect certain information about your device and your use of the App. This information helps us improve our services and provide a better user experience. This may include:

*   **Usage Data:** Information about your interactions with the App, such as features used, content accessed (e.g., which audio episodes are played, interaction with transcriptions), time spent in the App, and other engagement metrics. We may use services like Google Firebase Analytics for this purpose.

We utilize third-party services to provide and improve the App. These services may collect information as described in their own privacy policies:

*   **Supabase:** We use Supabase for backend services, including authentication, database management, and potentially other features. Supabase may collect information as detailed in their privacy policy ([https://supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy)), which can include usage data, IP addresses, and cookies.
*   **Google Services (Firebase & Sign-In):** We use Google Sign-In for authentication. Additionally, we may use other Google services such as Firebase for analytics (Firebase Analytics), crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics), and other backend functionalities. Google's collection and use of information are governed by Google's Privacy Policy ([https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).
*   **Apple (App Store & In-App Purchases):** If you make In-App Purchases, Apple processes these transactions. Apple's data collection and use are governed by their privacy policy. We do not receive or store your full payment card information.

*   **With Service Providers:** We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, as detailed in Section 1.3 (e.g., Supabase, Google/Firebase, Apple for IAPs). These providers assist with functions like backend infrastructure, authentication, analytics, crash reporting, and payment processing. These providers are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

## 4. Data Retention
